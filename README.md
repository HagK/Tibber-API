# Tibber-API

i will spread my API scripts to make my live easier
my standard tools:
* redis
* mosquitto /mqtt @victron
* python3 (i use still *copy* for compatibility)

## tibber prices today
* is a daily plaintext email to adjust your power consumption over the day
* list the costs and consumption of last days
* this script requires **redis** (w/o an exception was logged) to store consumption data

## awattar.py

To have an idea of next day prices, i use awattar-API, because the API of tibber for prices_tomorrow often results in HTTP/200 with empty content.
This EEX price is without tax, this result in an offset of 0,15 - 0,2 â‚¬
The output is only on stdout and also **redis** will be filled with results.
